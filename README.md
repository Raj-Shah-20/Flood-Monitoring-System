## Problem Statement 
<p align="justify">The purpose of this project is to sense the water level in river beds and check if they are in 
normal condition. If they reach beyond the limit, then it alerts people through LED signals with 
buzzer sound as well as internet applications.</p>

## Scope of the project
<p align="justify">Scope for the flood monitoring system is to monitor flooded regions and to avoid catastrophic 
conditions to happen. With the help of ultrasonic sensor, the system can detect the water level 
variation to find out the critical conditions to help evacuation services. With the help of buzzer 
and LED light, the people living around the water bodies can be notified about the current 
situations. Evacuation services and officials related to disaster relief can be notified via SOS 
notifications.</p>

## Features of the project
<p align = "justify"> 
1. It can be used for multiple purposes like for drainage, rivers, dams, sewers. <br><br>
2. It has multiple LED lights and a buzzer to alert the peoples who live in the area where the 
system is installed. <br><br>
3. It provides SOS notifications for people away from the system. <br><br>
4. It has live monitoring feature which helps in understanding the water level. <br><br>
5. It can show the current status of the water level using widgets available on cloud platform 
just like the physical LED component.<br><br></p>

## Conclusion and Future Scope
<p align = "justify">The Internet of Everything (IoE) is now widely used around the world. The data of 
the water level measured in ThingSpeak Cloud will be displayed by this system. If it continues to 
rain heavily, users may simply check the water level on their laptop or mobile phone from 
anywhere as long as they have an internet connection. This smart system can also control the 
alert signal and deliver evacuation notifications at the same time</p>

<p align = "justify">Flooding can also be related to the intensity of rainfall, which can increase height of the water 
covering the ground over time. As a result, the creation of a rainfall predicting sensor will 
eventually lead to early flood detection and monitoring.</p>
